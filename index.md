My name is Levi Starrett. I'm a software engineer and high school teacher by
day and a family man by night. My wife Courtney and I met at Purdue and got
married in 2016. We live in West Lafayette, IN and have 3 beautiful children --
Ezra (4), Brooklyn (2), and Spencer (1). Courtney's brother Nick (17) and
sister Lexi (13) also live with us and attend school in Lafayette. We are
active members of Faith Church of Lafaytte.

I grew up in Brookston, IN and went to high school at Faith Christian School in
Lafayette. I graduated from Purdue in 2016 and accepted a job working for a
software services company One Fact, Inc. I worked for 2 and a half years for an
agricultural services comany called Rogo. There I designed software systems for
all levels of the business from low level robotic control to cloud services and
front end applications. In fall of 2021 I transitioned to contract services
with my own company and teaching math at Faith Christian School. I'm now
working back at One Fact mostly on model compiler technology and software
architectures.

I'm passionate about computer science, teaching, and generally getting young
people interested in engineering and creative arts. I love getting "down on
the iron" and working with prototyping boards and other forms of DIY computer
hardware and robotics. I enjoy the challenge of encoding behavior for devices
that can be seen and touched. I have a membership at the MatchBOX Studio in
Lafayette and have been learning how to use some of the Maker Lab equipment
(mostly laser cutting).

I love to spend time with my family, work on engineering/maker side projects,
golf, make beer, and outdoor activities when I have time.

I also love motorcycles. In 2015 I was the proud owner of a 1986 Honda Shadow
which I rode cross country over 1500 miles from Boulder, CO through Nebraska,
South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois and back home to Lafayette.
