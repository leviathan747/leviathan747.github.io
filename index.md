I graduated from Purdue University with my BS in December of 2016. I took
particular interest in systems topics such as programming languages, compilers,
operating systems, networks, and computer security. While at Purdue, I was a
member of the Undergraduate Student Board for the CS department (USB) and
oversaw the teaching of the student-led CS 190 tools course. In the Fall
semester 2015, I was the main lecturer and wrote all of the labs for CS 190. CS
190 has since become a first class course and has been reassigned as CS 193. I
also worked as a tutor in the CS help room during my time in USB. In the Spring
semester 2016, I worked as a TA with Profs. Hubert Dunsmore and Doug Comer to
launch a new CS course aimed at non-STEM students. CS 101 (Digital Literacy) was
designed to provide a basic level of understanding of computing concepts to
non-technical students in order to equip them to interact in today's world.
