# Introduction

My name is Levi Starrett. I'm a software engineer by day and a family man by
night. My wife Courtney and I met at Purdue and got married in 2016. We live in
historic Lafayette and have a 1 year old son (Ezra). Courtney's two brothers
Nick (14) and Jacob (17) also live with us and attend school in Lafayette. We
are active members of Faith Church and attend Sunday services at the [Northend
Community Center](http://northend.cc).

I grew up in Brookston, IN and went to high school at Faith Christian School in
Lafayette. I graduated from Purdue in 2016 and accepted a job working for a
small software services company One Fact, Inc.

I love to spend time with my family, work on engineering/maker side projects,
golf, make beer, and outdoor activities when I have time.

I also love motorcycles. Unfortunately, I'm not a current owner, but in 2015 I
was the proud owner of a 1986 Honda Shadow which I rode cross country over 1500
miles from Boulder, CO through Nebraska, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois
and back home to Lafayette.

I graduated from Purdue University with my BS in December of 2016. I took
particular interest in systems topics such as programming languages, compilers,
operating systems, networks, and computer security. While at Purdue, I was a
member of the Undergraduate Student Board for the CS department (USB) and
oversaw the teaching of the student-led CS 190 tools course. In the Fall
semester 2015, I was the main lecturer and wrote all of the labs for CS 190. CS
190 has since become a first class course and has been reassigned as CS 193. I
also worked as a tutor in the CS help room during my time in USB. In the Spring
semester 2016, I worked as a TA with Profs. Hubert Dunsmore and Doug Comer to
launch a new CS course aimed at non-STEM students. CS 101 (Digital Literacy) was
designed to provide a basic level of understanding of computing concepts to
non-technical students in order to equip them to interact in today's world.
